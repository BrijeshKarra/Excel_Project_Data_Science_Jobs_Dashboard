# Excel Project: Data Science Jobs Dashboard 
![Excel Dashboard GIF](Visualizations/Dashboard.gif)

## Introduction

This dashboard was created to help data science job seekers investigate salaries for their desired jobs based on their preferred location and job type.

### Dashboard File
My final dashboard is in [Data Science Jobs Dashboard](Data_Science_Jobs_Dashboard.xlsx).

### Excel Skills Used

The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:

- **Charts**
- **Formulas and Functions**
- **Data Validation**

### Data Jobs Dataset

The [dataset](https://github.com/lukebarousse/Excel_Data_Analytics_Course/tree/main/0_Resources/Datasets) used for this project contains real-world data science job information from 2023, which provides a foundation for analyzing data using Excel. It includes detailed information on:

- **Job titles**
- **Salaries**
- **Locations**
- **Skills**

## Dashboard Build

### Charts

####  Data Science Job Salaries in Canada - Bar Chart

- **Excel Features:** Utilized bar chart feature (with formatted salary values) and optimized layout for clarity.
- **Design Choice:** Horizontal bar chart for  visual comparison of median salaries, making it easier to read.
- **Data Organization:** Sorted job titles by descending salary for improved clarity.
-  **Insights Gained:** This enables quick identification of salary trends, noting that Senior roles and Engineers are higher-paying than Analyst roles with ML Engineers earning the highest- over $150,000 annualy.

#### Â Country Median Salaries - Map Chart

- **Excel Features:** Utilized Excel's map chart feature to plot median salaries globally.
- **Design Choice:** Color-coded map to visually differentiate salary levels across regions.
- **Data Representation:** Plotted median salary for each country with available data.
- **Visual Enhancement:** Improved readability and immediate understanding of geographic salary trends.
-  **Insights Gained:** Enables quick grasp of global salary disparities and highlights high/low salary regions.

###  Formulas and Functions

####  Median Salary by Job Titles

- **Multi-Criteria Filtering:** Checks job title, excludes blank salaries, checks country, and schedule type.
- **Array Formula:** Utilizes `MEDIAN()` function with nested `IF()` statement to analyze an array.
- **Tailored Insights:** Provides specific salary information for job titles, regions, and schedule types.
- **Formula Purpose:** This formula populates the table below, returning the median salary based on job title, country, and type specified.

####  **Median Salary** Table for **Canadian Full-time** Data Science Roles

####  Count of Job Schedule Type

- **Multi-Criteria Filtering:** This Excel formula ,similar to the use of `MEDIAN()` function before, incorporates the `COUNT()` function to count the number of job schedule types based on given job tite and country.
- **Formula Purpose:** This formula populates the table below, which gives us a list of job schedule types.

### Data Validation

####  Filtered List

-  **Enhanced Data Validation:** Implementing the filtered list as a data validation rule under the `Job Title`, `Country`, and `Type` option in the Data tab ensures:
    -  User input is restricted to predefined, validated schedule types
    -  Incorrect or inconsistent entries are prevented
    -  Overall usability of the dashboard is enhanced



## Conclusion
This was my first Excel project ever. From writing that first `=sum()` as a beginner to actually building a full-fledged Dashboard, I was able to execute a lot of the skills I learned before working on this project.

The Dashboard provides insights into salary trends across various data-related job titles globally, allowing job seekers to make informed decisions about their career paths based on their preferred country of work and and job type.
